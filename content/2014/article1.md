Summary: Picks latest entry from atom feed and post it on facebook 

If you are visiting this Blog entry from my Facebook Post, then I assume that my python script is able to pick the latest entry from the Atom feed and post the link on the facebook ;)
This Blog entry should have been posted to facebook ;)

###TODO: 

1. Clean Up and Proof Read the exisiting blog post.

2. Ignore the first task.

>> The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
>> Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.
