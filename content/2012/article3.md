These last couple of days have been pretty hard actually, and my only true companion has been the Nexus 7. I actaully like the tablet , alot actaully mainly because of jellybean , the quadcore Nvidia tegra 3 and ah lets say High Def Screen.I have been using Samsung Galaxy Ace for more than a year now , so it's a good upgrade for me.

So, I have been using the tablet for some twenty plus days as of now.
Lets talk about what's actually lacking in this Tablet.Well for me on the hardware part I paid Rs 16,000 including Delivery (tradus.com), I don't really have to rant anything about it.It's everything I expect for  a sub 20K budget - 3G ! "Screw you Asus for that ".Asus got the pricing wrong in India and they will pay for it.

On the software front , well No complains with JellyBean it's super smooth especially considering the fact I am coming from CM7.2 on my Galaxy ace,there are plenty of changes.Yes , Android has finally came out of the beta and its  ready for the masses now.I didn't encounter any lag on the device except once or twice while playing subwaysurfers , possibly that could be a problem with the app.Everything else is running smooth like "Butter ;)".

Eversince I took Nexus 7 out of the box , I am rarely using my laptop and cell phone for browsing internet.Actually 7 inch form factor fits just right in.Reading my emails , facebook or twitter or Quora I am lot more comfortable with the tab.Since last three days I have been down with Chicken Pox , and Nexus 7 has been my friend in the misery.I was in a state ,where I could barely move or sit properly ,but I had to Study as my EndSemester exams are going on.Thanks to Nexus 7 , I prepared for Operating System Paper as I had the Ebook and Slides to study the concepts.I have been reading lot more on the tab then the books.

Google Now is also an awesome addition to the android and it's just a glimse what future holds ,actaully this app really learns from our search history and trends and well it usually pops up a card about the time I leave college for my hostel, It's a cool feature and soon it could be a usp for android.I believe the day is not far enough ,when something like Google Now + project glass will automatically provide us with the information and data we would require at any given location.

PlayStore , same old story.Yet not enough Tablet optimized apps and this is where iOs takes away the glory from the android.Personally I like the interface of Jellybean and 4.0 >=  devices a lot more then iOS 6,but the applications that run on the iOS are like way more polished and slick.Lets say Flipboard on Nexus 7 is good ,but it's just scaled up version of mobile app so is the Quora or the Facebook.Well this is just a temporary problem , I just hope more and more developers develop Tablet Optimised apps for Android Devices in the near future.
