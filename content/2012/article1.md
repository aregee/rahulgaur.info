###Happy Birthday to me!
------------------------

So ,This year I am finally with my parents for my **birthday**.
It's gonna be a low key affair this time.
We all know what happens at birthdays back in college,but things are different this time as I am with my parents.
Guess what ? .. There , they even got a birthday cake for me with candle  "21" .
Well, "21st" birthday doesn't change much, except made me realise what my life has been till date .

My "20th" birthday was awesome, well until ...cops showed up at my apartment, I will get to the how and why part of it later.
Now that changes life, though I have been pretty late to realize but that was the warning.So,now I'm 21 and I need to get my act together."Teenage is way over now", I am into the end of fifth semester of engineering and three semesters more I did be so called "Indian Engineeer" yet another **B-TAK** grad :D.

Back in the year "2011",it was full of many higs and lows, The "Google Summer of Code" , hot new girlfriend enough cash in hand and lots of coding was what I did ...**well until** then.
I saw people around me having fun , partying and still being able to score decent marks in semesters , I was missing on a lot of the "fun high and crazy part of it !".
I dived in head first and I could litereally swim deap in the requim of my dream and when that wasn't enough "I fell in love" and this time it happened for real.The dream needs to be broken and I think now it does.I still loved hacking around and building new stuff but the regularity part of it got lost somewhere.
I was living my life and litreally I meant it ,I was living it up.Doing all sorts of things I never imagined that I would do.

So, then came *the day*, that kind of sort of left an impression "20-11-2011".All fourteen of us who were there at my apartment, won't forget it.We never planned any party,but everything fell in place like the s**t had to happen.
I planed out to celeberate it with my *Love* -*The One That Got Away* , but it didn't worked out.I couldn't make it to New Delhi and I was stuck in Meerut once again for the day.

  

###Why the Cops ended up at our place ?
--------------------------------------


Me and three other friends of mine used to rent an apartment back then.I just don't want to get into explaining that.All I can tell you is "NOISE, NEIGHBOURS & COPS"..but to make a point here "We were Bloddy innocent & were being framed".
What next ? , well we all know what engineers in making do at birthdays.This was no different event . 
There wasn't any bit of food ,but sure there was booze.
What I remember , actually fragments of my memories , some of us were asked to get into a jeep others in neighbour's car and we were driven down to the police station, in between our we tried to put whatever we have learned uptill college into real practice.While enroute to station a friend of mine finally gutted up and said to one of the officier sitting in the car "Uncle ,please jaaney do ..police station na ley jao 14 laundey hai and kal 14,000 rupay aap koh la kar deney key gurantee meree..please janey do "...
We know how things work in real world , it's ironic to the teachings imparted to us through out our life.
But still we did went up to the police station.Most of us were wearing jsut a T-shirts ,lowers or shorts.
Most of us weren't wearing any slippers everything happened in such a jiffy ,we didn't had time to react.
Actaully, the cops turned out to be nice ,not like our **Rich & Bloddy arrogant** neighbours.
So, somewhere around 01:00 or 1:30 am in night we were at the police station.Sitting there on the floor and still shamelessly passing a giggle when we crossed a glance.When that wasn't enough, someone cracked a joke "Abey yar, jab tak baithey hai ek Joint bana lo"..and everyone burst into a sudden laughter.
Then, we talked and talked a lot to those cops.They acutally understood the situation and they did warn us not to party at this time of the night and all sorts of blah ..blah.
We nooded, and then we left the station somewhere around 3:00 am or so.We had no means to travel back roughly 5 or 6 kms to our apartment except our foots.We were tad too scared to go there in the first place.
So , we decided to head to a friend's place and stay over there for the night.That was even more far far away.
No slippers , no sweaters that's how most of us were and that too in the cold november nights of the north india.

Screwed Up semester , screwed up relationship and screwing up whatsoever good is left in my life..

###I Want To Come out Clean !
-----------------------------

I want to make a fresh start in my life.I wish life was like a computers ,give it a reboot and the glitch is usually gone or format it and its like brand new canvas again.Unfortunately , the way life turns out to be is like a book and a new chapter is being added to it everyday.You may tear out the previous pages but then you are not you.You're story is incomplete , it's broken.Only thing we can do is start a new page and try to write a different story this time.
The one that is concurrently better than the previous phases of your life.
Since last semester , I am trying and I am trying hard to get back on the track and I think I am in the service lane already , getting repairs done at the pit stop.
I am not saying that "Is semester say padhai karunga " dialog anymore.No, I don't want to top in my batch either.That's now how I visualize my self.Frankly it's not my turf either.
"All the crazy Sh*t I did ,Those would the best memories but I just wanna let it go".
Being an engineer wasn't my dream ever and neither do I consider my slef as one.I am here just because I love computers and everything tech.Even as a Kid ,"when I grew up all I want to do is sit infront of a Computer screen..Multiple monitors Black and Green Terminal write commands and codes that make the computer do some crazy things " the wow factor.

It's kind of sort of what I am doing , and I want to carry on with that.This Community specially Linux and the whole open source community has given me a lot.It means world to me !
Some people do this all coding thing for the money part of it or whatsoever.I grew up whole my live wanting to live this wow factor , wanting to build things write cool scripts and hack around.I am living my childhood dream actually.Not my ambition, but my dream like fantasy !  
This is all possible just because of awesome people working in the open source community.They are the reason I have access to plenty of world class cuttingdge technologies at my finger tip.
This is just because the open source community ,that today I am living my childhood dream.
This is the only part of my life, coding part and fiddling around with my computer that makes me very happy.I am trying hard because I don't want to lose this. 
I have been putting a lot of my ideas back into the shelf and leaving them incomplete..

###Now what I am goin to do is :
-------------------------------	
   	::::python
	for idea in ideaList:
     	    build(idea)
    
    


###Lets Start a new page :

----------------------------- 
			      
    ::::console 
    root@linuxstation rahulgaur# touch newphase.life | ls | grep newphase
    newphase.life
    root@linuxstation# echo -e "happy birthday to me once again \n bye for now "
    happy birthday to me once again 
    bye for now
