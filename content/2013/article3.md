Summary: I have migrated my blog from Hyde to Pelican and I have been busy with GSoC since June ;)


So , the last post I wrote was back in the month of December [about]({filename}/2012/article3.md) my nexus 7.I haven't been able to blog anything since then mostly a pretty hectic and engaging college life and equally pathetic internet conectivity.My previous blog site was made with [Hyde][] , I really liked it when I started but eventually hyde became obsolete and there and unmaintained.The Design and layout of the previous blog wasn't any good either.The usability was thrown out of the window and I was considering different alternatives to redesign the site.
This time I wanted my online residence to be clutter free and useable.With these goals in mind , I set out to consider couple of static site generators.I tried [Jekyll][] , new updated version of Hyde with bootstrap template.Then there was [Pelican][] ;-) 
I had to restructure my site , this was on my mind eversince I created this blog site and registered my domain back in November last [year]({filename}/2012/article1.md).However since June 2013 I have been quite busy with my Google Summer of Code project. I applied for it again this year and got selected for SugarLabs , but more on this later.I plan to document my GSoC time frame in several blog post of the next month.
Lets talk about Pelican , I felt pretty comfortable wit Pelican since the start.Last night at around 02:00am I found out about Pelican and I went through the docs and couple of examples.I felt it was lot less complex than Hyde , faster then Jekyll and lot of things work out of the box.I find Pelician to be prett mature project specially in comparison with Hyde.
Articles and Pages are indexed pretty well, coming from Hyde I remember last time I was building my site , I took me around a week to complete the project and endresult wasn't really satisfactory but what the hell I just let it be.
