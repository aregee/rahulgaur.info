Summary: GSoC 2013 final evaluation results are out and its official now I have successfully pased completed the program.

Google Summer of code 2013 results for the final evaluation came out last night. I was feeling slight feverish since yesterday and I was pretty exhausted so I tried to go to sleep little early just like normal human beings.Eventually fate doesn't permit that , I thin Melange went bonkers last night and started sending erroneous emails to all the GSoC participants.
I was just trying to sleep when this email came by and I got excited not even reading it "Congraulations" was all I saw ;-)
As the excitement fadded away , I read the email and it was a *facepalm* .
There was a feeling of realization that the results would be out by 19:00 UTC , there was still an hour to go.I couldn't sleep waiting egarely for the result.The official mail came somewhere around 34 minutes past the midnight and I slept like a baby after reading email.

Thanks Martin , Claudia and everyone at the SugarLabs community for such an awesome opportunity. However this is just the start , there are lot of things which could not be completed within the GSoC time frame.I have more time now and I hope to target those features ,that I have left.
Lets start with AngularJs , I have some glaring errors in my approach.
