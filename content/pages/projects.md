I am an advocate Open Source softwares and I evangelize other people to get on the OSS wagon :-)  

Most of the work I have done so far can be tracked on [github][]. 
I try my best to [motivate][] my friends , school kids and girls to get started with programing.
I try to showcase fun and [exciting][] side of coding to get first timers interested.  

Here is a short introduction of some of my projects:

*    [Moksaya][]: This project was a part of my GSoC internship for SugarLabs.Goal of this project was to provide a social collaboration and sharing platform where users of Sugar Activities can share their projects with other Sugar Users.Moksaya is web server written in Django and it provides RESTful interface so that this platform can be integerated in the Sugar Learning Environment. 

*    [Moksaya-Web][]: Moksaya-Web is a web client which consumes the RESTful APIs provided by the Moksaya project.The web app is still in a nascent stage but it provides basic functionality such as user signup , login , project uploads, project forking , likes , comments , follower followee relationship etcs.

     
*    [Resultworks][]: This was my first django application which I developed as a part of Facebook KRDS hackathon.It's a web application designed to manage grade reports for the students.The admin or teachers can login and grade the Students for the subject they are teaching.Students can query the result with their roll numbers.I haven't worked on this project for a while but I intend to build it as a open source project for managing grade reports and attendance records for the students.
