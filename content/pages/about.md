I am trying real hard to be a software developer ;-) ,On a personal note  I love computers and beer!
Sometimes I go to college as I am yet to graduate (expected 2014), but on a regular day I am at [Openlabs](http://www.openlabs.co.in/team) with bunch of really awesome hackers trying to take the world with storm.

[Python] being my most prefered programing language , I enjoy writing codes and work on challenging problems.
I have been falling for [AngularJs](http://www.angularjs.org) recently which has stuck my fancy lately.

Emacs >>> Sublime 2 >>> MacVim (vim)

Being a G33k  is my day job, nevertheless I enjoy reading about phsycology, economics, science fiction in my spare time.

> Music is my special friend !

I could listen to discographies of The Doors , Pink Floyd , Mettalica , Bob Dylan on an endless loop.

> And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
> Racing around to come up behind you again
> The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
> Shorter of breath and one day closer to death

Sometimes I enjoy listenting to reggae from The Wailers and Bob Marley era and Eminem.

> Days are bright and filled with pain
